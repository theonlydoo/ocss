OwnCloud Screenshot Sharing

A script to make sharing a screenshot publicly via an Owncloud server easy.

This script takes a screenshot (of a window or rectangular area), uploads it to the configured OwnCloud server, enables public sharing by URL on the uploaded screenshot, and copies the URL to your clipboard.


Dependencies:
-------------

Shared:
  - curl
  - grep

Linux:
  - gnome-screenshot
  - notify-send
  - shutter



Instructions:
-------------

Get ocss.sh by either cloning this repo or downloading the zip.
Edit the CONFIG portion of ocss.sh and fill in your details/preferences.  By default, it's setup to save screenshots locally to $HOME/Pictures/ocss (config setting: file_dir), so either change that to a directory that exists or create that directory.  Also by default, it will upload the screenshots to a folder named "ocss" in your Owncloud root (config setting: oc_ocss_dir_name)... make sure that exists.  The default open command that opens a browser to display your new upload is chromium (config setting: open_command).

Run it with the "check" argument to check if all required dependencies exist.

`$ ./ocss.sh check`

I haven't tested this with OS X, but it's mostly the same code base as imgur-screenshot and that is purported to work in OS X, so it SHOULD work.
